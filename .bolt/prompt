📂 PitchPerfect – AI Context File - This should serve as overall project context, however the PROMPT given by the user should ALWAYS take precedence if there is conflicting information. 

🔥 Project Overview
- Name: PitchPerfect
- Type: AI-powered interview preparation platform
- Goal: Deliver dynamic, lifelike interview simulations using AI avatars, voice/video, and personalized preparation.
- Built For: World's Largest Hackathon presented by Bolt
